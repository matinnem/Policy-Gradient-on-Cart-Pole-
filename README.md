# Policy-Gradient-on-Cart-Pole
in this repository I made a Cart Pole environment (by help of Gym module) in python and I used the policy gradient method to make neural network (by help of PyTorch)
to hold the Pole in 200 iterations. I chose the 3000 to 3500 times that agent trys to hold the Pole in 200 iterations. There are two jupyter notebooks, one of them is suitable for cpu and another one is in gpu (cuda) mode.
my reference book for this notebook is "Deep Reinforcement Learning In Action".
